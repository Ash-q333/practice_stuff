Difference between document and window objects.

In JavaScript, both the document and window objects are essential components of the Document Object Model (DOM).

The document object: Its scope is within the content of a webpage. It represents the HTML document structure and provides access to the elements and content within the document.
The primary purpose of the document object is to provide methods and properties for interacting with the contents of the document. Ex: you can use document.getElementById() to retrieve a specific element by its ID.

The window object: represents the global environment in which the JavaScript code is executed(browser).
It contains everything within the browser window, including the document object.
It provides access to global functions and properties, such as alert(), setTimeout(), and localStorage. These functions and properties are available globally.
